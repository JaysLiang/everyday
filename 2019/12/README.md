## docker problem
```
	for docker safety, so docker images should use non-root user to execute file.
	alpine operating system seems can not execute file when as a non-root user
```

## shell

### tar

```
	if there are too many small files, such as more than 200,000. we need to tar some 
	small pack, like 10 pack, each pack is a dir, and contains lots of files.
        we need tar.sh to tar sud-dir. 	
```
